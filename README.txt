This repository is a drill inside Coursera's Getting and Cleaning data course.

# Files

run_analysis.R: executes an analysis over a given set of raw data
readme.md: contains the information you are seeing now
tidy.txt: the output data of .R script

# Analysis

The analysis performs the following steps:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
